/// this information automatically. For example, [ListView] provides each child
/// widget with a semantic index automatically and sets the semantic child
/// count to the length of the list.
///
/// To determine visible indexes, the scroll view needs a way to associate the
/// generated semantics of each scrollable item with a semantic index. This can
/// be done by wrapping the child widgets in an [IndexedSemantics].
///
/// This semantic index is not necessarily the same as the index of the widget in
/// the scrollable, because some widgets may not contribute semantic
/// information. Consider a [ListView.separated]: every other widget is a
/// divider with no semantic information. In this case, only odd numbered
/// widgets have a semantic index (equal to the index ~/ 2). Furthermore, the
/// total number of children in this example would be half the number of
/// widgets. (The [ListView.separated] constructor handles this
/// automatically; this is only used here as an example.)
///
/// The total number of visible children can be provided by the constructor
/// parameter `semanticChildCount`. This should always be the same as the
/// number of widgets wrapped in [IndexedSemantics].

  /// ## What is a sliver?
  ///
  /// > _**sliver** (noun): a small, thin piece of something._
  ///
  /// A _sliver_ is a widget backed by a [RenderSliver] subclass, i.e. one that
  /// implements the constraint/geometry protocol that uses [SliverConstraints]
  /// and [SliverGeometry].
  ///
  /// This is as distinct from those widgets that are backed by [RenderBox]
  /// subclasses, which use [BoxConstraints] and [Size] respectively, and are
  /// known as box widgets. (Widgets like [Container], [Row], and [SizedBox] are
  /// box widgets.)
  ///
  /// While boxes are much more straightforward (implementing a simple
  /// two-dimensional Cartesian layout system), slivers are much more powerful,
  /// and are optimized for one-axis scrolling environments.
  ///
  /// Slivers are hosted in viewports, also known as scroll views, most notably
  /// [SuperScroll].
  ///
  /// ## Examples of slivers
  ///
  /// The Flutter framework has many built-in sliver widgets, and custom widgets
  /// can be created in the same manner. By convention, sliver widgets always
  /// start with the prefix `Sliver` and are always used in properties called
  /// `sliver` or `slivers` (as opposed to `child` and `children` which are used
  /// for box widgets).
  ///
  /// Examples of widgets unique to the sliver world include:
  ///
  /// * [SliverList], a lazily-loading list of variably-sized box widgets.
  /// * [SliverFixedExtentList], a lazily-loading list of box widgets that are
  ///   all forced to the same height.
  /// * [SliverPrototypeExtentList], a lazily-loading list of box widgets that
  ///   are all forced to the same height as a given prototype widget.
  /// * [SliverGrid], a lazily-loading grid of box widgets.
  /// * [SliverAnimatedList] and [SliverAnimatedGrid], animated variants of
  ///   [SliverList] and [SliverGrid].
  /// * [SliverFillRemaining], a widget that fills all remaining space in a
  ///   scroll view, and lays a box widget out inside that space.
  /// * [SliverFillViewport], a widget that lays a list of boxes out, each
  ///   being sized to fit the whole viewport.
  /// * [SliverPersistentHeader], a sliver that implements pinned and floating
  ///   headers, e.g. used to implement [SliverAppBar].
  /// * [SliverToBoxAdapter], a sliver that wraps a box widget.
  ///
  /// Examples of sliver variants of common box widgets include:
  ///
  /// * [SliverOpacity], [SliverAnimatedOpacity], and [SliverFadeTransition],
  ///   sliver versions of [Opacity], [AnimatedOpacity], and [FadeTransition].
  /// * [SliverIgnorePointer], a sliver version of [IgnorePointer].
  /// * [SliverLayoutBuilder], a sliver version of [LayoutBuilder].
  /// * [SliverOffstage], a sliver version of [Offstage].
  /// * [SliverPadding], a sliver version of [Padding].
  /// * [SliverReorderableList], a sliver version of [ReorderableList]
  /// * [SliverSafeArea], a sliver version of [SafeArea].
  /// * [SliverVisibility], a sliver version of [Visibility].
  ///
  /// ## Benefits of slivers over boxes
  ///
  /// The sliver protocol ([SliverConstraints] and [SliverGeometry]) enables
  /// _scroll effects_, such as floating app bars, widgets that expand and
  /// shrink during scroll, section headers that are pinned only while the
  /// section's children are visible, etc.
  ///

  ///
  /// ## Mixing slivers and boxes
  ///
  /// In general, slivers always wrap box widgets to actually render anything
  /// (for example, there is no sliver equivalent of [Text] or [Container]);
  /// the sliver part of the equation is mostly about how these boxes should
  /// be laid out in a viewport (i.e. when scrolling).
  ///
  /// Typically, the simplest way to combine boxes into a sliver environment is
  /// to use a [SliverList] (maybe using a [ListView, which is a convenient
  /// combination of a [SuperScroll] and a [SliverList]). In rare cases,
  /// e.g. if a single [Divider] widget is needed between two [SliverGrid]s,
  /// a [SliverToBoxAdapter] can be used to wrap the box widgets.
  ///
  /// ## Performance considerations
  ///
  /// Because the purpose of scroll views is to, well, scroll, it is common
  /// for scroll views to contain more contents than are rendered on the screen
  /// at any particular time.
  ///
  /// To improve the performance of scroll views, the content can be rendered in
  /// _lazy_ widgets, notably [SliverList] and [SliverGrid] (and their variants,
  /// such as [SliverFixedExtentList] and [SliverAnimatedGrid]). These widgets
  /// ensure that only the portion of their child lists that are actually
  /// visible get built, laid out, and painted.
  ///
  /// The [ListView] and [GridView] widgets provide a convenient way to combine
  /// a [SuperScroll] and a [SliverList] or [SliverGrid] (respectively).
