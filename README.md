# cupertino_menu

A draft implementation of a iOS menu in Flutter. !!This should not be used in production!! It exists to demonstrate how an expandable dropdown menu could function in Flutter. [Check out this project](https://github.com/notDmDrl/pull_down_button) for a polished Cupertino menu that you can use in your applications (and that inspired this repo).
